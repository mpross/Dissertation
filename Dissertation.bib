It is capable of reducing inertial motion by more than two orders of magnitude at 100 mHz compared with what is achievable with state-of-the-art seismometers. This will enable substantial improvements in the low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors. The scheme is inherently two-stage, the reference mass is softly suspended within the platform to be isolated, which is itself suspended from the ground. The platform is held constant relative to the reference mass and this closed-loop control effectively transfers the low acceleration-noise of the reference mass to the platform. The loop gain also reduces non-linear couplings and dynamic range requirements in the soft-suspension mechanics and the interferometric sensing.}

abstract = {Abstract Seismic models show that the shallow mantle beneath the contiguous United States is characterized by low velocities west of the Rocky Mountain Front, high velocities beneath the North American craton, and moderate wave speeds along the eastern seaboard. However, numerous questions remain, including the distribution of temperature and partial melt in the mantle that may explain the slower velocities in the west; the origin and depth extent of the western edge of the cratonic lithosphere; and explanations for slower velocities observed along the eastern seaboard. To investigate these questions, we have measured teleseismic Rayleigh wave phase and amplitude at USArray stations for periods of 25–180 s and calculated phase velocity using the Helmholtz tomography method. Notably, the new long-period maps represent an opportunity to resolve mantle structure at sublithospheric depths and show differences relative to shorter periods in both the distribution of slow velocities in the west and the extent of fast velocities in the central United States. The maps are then used as a basis for comparing six recent 3-D shear velocity models of the contiguous United States, from which we predict phase velocities. While predictions from surface-wave models agree best with our observations at short and intermediate periods, the longest-period maps are most similar in amplitude to body-wave models.},

As compared with previous LIGO detectors, there will be increased complexity in the optical configuration, improved seismic isolation system and significantly higher power circulating in the arm cavities. In the new detectors, the control of the angular orientation of the mirrors will be particularly challenging. The advanced LIGO (aLIGO) mirrors need to have a residual angular motion of the order of 1 nrad RMS in order to achieve high sensitivity. In the high power regime, the torque induced by radiation pressure effects will be comparable with the restoring torque of the mirror suspension, such that we must think of the opto-mechanical response, instead of just the mechanical response. These modifications have to be considered in order to design the control strategy for keeping the mirrors well aligned. Moreover, to meet the sensitivity target the alignment control noise coupled to the gravitational-wave channel must be well below  at 10 Hz. We developed a model of the alignment sensing and control scheme of aLIGO which takes into account radiation pressure effects and meets the noise target.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {On 2017 August 17, the gravitational-wave event GW170817 was observed by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, and the gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 170817A was observed independently by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, and the Anti-Coincidence Shield for the Spectrometer for the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory. The probability of the near-simultaneous temporal and spatial observation of GRB 170817A and GW170817 occurring by chance is . We therefore confirm binary neutron star mergers as a progenitor of short GRBs. The association of GW170817 and GRB 170817A provides new insight into fundamental physics and the origin of short GRBs. We use the observed time delay of  between GRB 170817A and GW170817 to: (i) constrain the difference between the speed of gravity and the speed of light to be between  and  times the speed of light, (ii) place new bounds on the violation of Lorentz invariance, (iii) present a new test of the equivalence principle by constraining the Shapiro delay between gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. We also use the time delay to constrain the size and bulk Lorentz factor of the region emitting the gamma-rays. GRB 170817A is the closest short GRB with a known distance, but is between 2 and 6 orders of magnitude less energetic than other bursts with measured redshift. A new generation of gamma-ray detectors, and subthreshold searches in existing detectors, will be essential to detect similar short bursts at greater distances. Finally, we predict a joint detection rate for the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors of 0.1–1.4 per year during the 2018–2019 observing run and 0.3–1.7 per year at design sensitivity.}

The two instruments are identical in design, and are specialized versions of a Michelson interferometer with 4 km long arms. As in Initial LIGO, Fabry–Perot cavities are used in the arms to increase the interaction time with a gravitational wave, and power recycling is used to increase the effective laser power. Signal recycling has been added in Advanced LIGO to improve the frequency response. In the most sensitive frequency region around 100 Hz, the design strain sensitivity is a factor of 10 better than Initial LIGO. In addition, the low frequency end of the sensitivity band is moved from 40 Hz down to 10 Hz. All interferometer components have been replaced with improved technologies to achieve this sensitivity gain. Much better seismic isolation and test mass suspensions are responsible for the gains at lower frequencies. Higher laser power, larger test masses and improved mirror coatings lead to the improved sensitivity at mid and high frequencies. Data collecting runs with these new instruments are planned to begin in mid-2015.}

	journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
	abstract = {In many models of inflation, the period of accelerated expansion ends with preheating, a
highly non-thermal phase of evolution during which the inflaton pumps energy into a
specific set of momentum modes of field(s) to which it is coupled. This necessarily
induces large, transient density inhomogeneities which can source a significant
spectrum of gravitational waves. In this paper, we consider the generic properties of
gravitational waves produced during preheating, perform detailed calculations of
the spectrum for several specific inflationary models, and identify problems that
require further study. In particular, we argue that if these gravitational waves exist
they will necessarily fall within the frequency range that is feasible for direct
detection experiments—from laboratory through to solar system scales. We extract
the gravitational wave spectrum from numerical simulations of preheating after
λϕ4 
and mϕ2ϕ2 
inflation, and find that they lead to a gravitational wave amplitude of around
Ωgwh2∼10−10. This is considerably higher than the amplitude of the primordial gravitational waves
produced during inflation. However, the typical wavelength of these gravitational waves is
considerably shorter than LIGO scales, although in extreme cases they may be visible at
scales accessible to the proposed BBO mission. We survey possible experimental
approaches to detecting any gravitational wave background generated during preheating.}

	abstract = {The mitigation of terrestrial gravity noise, also known as Newtonian noise (NN), is one of the foremost challenges to improve low-frequency sensitivity of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. At frequencies above 1 Hz, it is predicted that gravity noise from seismic surface Rayleigh waves is the dominant contribution to NN in surface detectors, and may still contribute significantly in future underground detectors. Noise cancellation based on a coherent estimate of NN using data from a seismometer array was proposed in the past. In this article, we propose an alternative scheme to cancel NN using a seismic tiltmeter. It is shown that even under pessimistic assumptions concerning the complexity of the seismic field, a single tiltmeter under each test mass of the detector is sufficient to achieve substantial noise cancellation. A technical tiltmeter design is presented to achieve the required sensitivity in the Newtonian-noise frequency band.}

For the convenience of the reader the theory of gravitational waves and their production, already known in principle, is given in the first part of this paper.After encountering relationships which cast doubt on the existence of rigorous solutions for undulatory gravitational fields, we investigate rigorously the case of cylindrical gravitational waves. It turns out that rigorous solutions exist and that the problem reduces to the usual cylindrical waves in euclidean space."
